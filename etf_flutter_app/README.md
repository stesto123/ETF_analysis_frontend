Quick start for the Flutter scaffold

Prerequisites:
- Flutter SDK installed and on PATH
- Android SDK / emulator configured for running apps on Linux (or a physical Android device)
- VS Code Flutter & Dart extensions installed (you already ran the install commands)

From the repo root:

1. cd etf_flutter_app
2. flutter pub get
3. flutter run

Notes:
- This is a scaffold converting the key utilities and API service from the original React Native app into Dart.
- UI is minimal; port React components into Flutter widgets as needed.
